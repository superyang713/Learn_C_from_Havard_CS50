Goal: Sort the following numbers in the ascending order.
      (3.18, 1.36, -0.12, 0.53, 1.92, 0.98)

The total number N of the numbers is N = 6.
Step 1:
    for i in (0, N-1) exclusively,
        if i*th number < i+1*th number,
            keep them.
        if i*th number > i+1*th number,
            swap two numbers.

Step 2:
    repeat step 1 until no more swap is needed.
