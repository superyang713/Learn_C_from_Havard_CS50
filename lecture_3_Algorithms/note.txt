search:

linear search -- O(n) --> on the order of n.
binary search -- divide and conquer O(log n) --> on the order of log n.


sorting;

bubble sort -- O(n²) --> the order of n² runningtime.
selection sort
insertion sort
merge sort -- use recursion --> (similar to binary search) O(n log n)


Notations:

O --> the upper bound of the running time.
Ω --> the lower bound of the running time.

The special characters in vim (such as Ω and ²) are inserted as followed:
    1. in the insert mode, type <C-K>
    2. type the code for the special characters. For example, Ω is W*, ² is 2S.


Recursion for sorting:

on input of n elements
    if n < 2
        return
    else
        sort left half of elements
        sort right half of elements
        merge sorted halves
